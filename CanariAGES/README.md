This script allows the user to take certain final values from a VPLanet run (the "Canari" run) and insert them into the input file of another one (the "AGES" run) as initial values.
Still crude, but functional. Runs on it's own without much supervision, very use-case to this study, not yet optimised for generalised use.

CanariAGES outputs a new directory with the values already edited.
